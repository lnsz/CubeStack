Voxel based game written in Java and Processing. This was initially a project I worked on for a grade 12 computer science class. I kept working on it afterwards and made a lot of improvements to the point where it is now.


The game will generate a rectangular platform of blocks that can be destroyed with by left clicking and added to the player's inventory. Blocks in the invetory can be placed with right click. By digging deeper, more types of resources can be found.

Controls:

WASD: Move

Space: Jump / Fly up

Shift: Fly down

Left click: Destroy a block / shoot

Right click: Place a block

M: Switch render modes

L: Toggle Lights (No lights has much better performance)

B: Toggle info

K: Toggle shooting mode

N: Toggle noClip
